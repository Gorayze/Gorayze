## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Um, I'm not sure what to write here, so I'll write this.

 -Currently studying in a technical college for a technician-programmer specialty.
 
 -Trying to learn Python on my own; if my code doesn't work well, feel free to correct it, Iâ€™ll only be happy!
 
 -So far, I've only studied SQL, HTML, and JavaScript in college. I know most of them aren't programming languages, but still.
 
 -I'm interested in cybersecurity; the whole field just seems fascinating to me.
